# Evaluation artefacts for RoboCert

This repository contains snapshots of the various RoboCert artefacts, for use in evaluating:

- the tool (in the form of RoboCert plugins for Eclipse);
- a case study (the foraging robot of Buchanan et al.).

The reference manual is [elsewhere](http://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/publications/reports/robocert.pdf).

## NOTE

As of writing (2022-05-08), the contents of this repository are provisional; the
plugins have not yet been tested outside of the environment in which their zip
was created, and the case study may need some tidying up to reflect the latest
paper draft.  These will happen as soon as possible.  Apologies for the
inconvenience caused.

## Contents

- `robocert.zip`: zip of Eclipse plugin JARs
- `foraging/`: foraging case study (see enclosed README).

## Prerequisites

To install the tool, you will need:

- Eclipse (tested with 2022-03);
- RoboTool version 3 (tested with CSP generator v3.0.0.202202010017; we recommend installing all plugins)
