# Evaluation artefacts for RoboCert

This repository contains snapshots of the various RoboCert artefacts,
for use in evaluating:

- the tool (in the form of RoboCert plugins for Eclipse: `tool/`);
- a case study (the foraging robot of Buchanan et al: `foraging/`).

The reference manual is
[elsewhere](http://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/publications/reports/robocert.pdf).
Since, at time of writing, its treatment of the RoboCert semantics is
incomplete, we provide Java source code for the generator in
`generator-src.zip`; the code of interest starts in the
`robostar.robocert.textual.generator.tockcsp` package.

Instructions on how to use the artefacts are included in their
respective directories.
