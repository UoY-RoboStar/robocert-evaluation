# Update sites for tool

These two directories form Eclipse update sites.  You should be able to just
clone them and point the Eclipse 'install new software' dialogue at them,
using its 'Add > Local' feature.

Install RoboChart and its dependencies first.

You will likely need to install the metamodel first, then the textual
plugin.
